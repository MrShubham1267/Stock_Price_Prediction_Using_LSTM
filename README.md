# Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_LSTM

## 📝 Description

Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties. We will develop this project into two parts:

#### 1.First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
#### 2.Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.

# Dataset
### 1.To build the stock price prediction model, we will use the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset. This is a dataset of Tata Beverages from Tata Global Beverages Limited, National Stock Exchange of India: Tata Global Dataset
### 2.To develop the dashboard for stock analysis we will use another stock dataset with multiple stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook: Stocks Dataset
